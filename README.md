ABSTRACT


AGUIAR, ALINE. Simulation of a Distribution Center 4.0. 2023. 78 f. Course Completion Work (Technologist Degree in Systems Analysis and Development) – Faculty of Exact Sciences and Engineering, State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 2023.

      In this work, my objective was to carry out a simulation of a fully automated Distribution Center 4.0. Firstly, the contents of the technologies used in it were described, such as the disruptive ones that led to its implementation, such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, among others that integrate and enable its implementation.
      In a post-pandemic period and an increasingly competitive world, those who have the best and most powerful tools to meet an increasingly significant volume of demands remain. Therefore, I researched and found the Nvídia Omniverse platform to implement the CD 4.0 Simulation that I developed using the Python language and the platform's available resources to implement it. 
    I counted on the contribution of Digital Twins and Isaac Sim to create this virtual simulation environment that provides prior development where I can visualize in advance and with greater assertiveness the possible probable scenarios that I will encounter and decide on what meets the highest level of productivity and reduction of costs.

Keywords: CD 4.0 simulation. Nvidia Omniverse. Digital Twins, Isaac Sim.
